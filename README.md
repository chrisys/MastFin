# MastFin

This is my repo for my [balenaFin](https://balena.io/fin) that's up a mast.

It's a combo of a [LoRa TTN Gateway](https://github.com/balena-io-playground/ttn-gateway-balenafin) and [ADS-B receiver](https://github.com/ketilmo/balena-ads-b). Also [dashboard](https://github.com/balenablocks/dashboard), [connector](https://github.com/balenablocks/connector), and [InfluxDB](https://hub.docker.com/_/influxdb).
